What Does This App Do?
======================
This is a simple Android application that allows you to access the built in settings screen to select additional input language for your Android keyboard. The primary motivation for creation of this app was the fact that the Kindle Fire does not allow you to select languages while including the secret settings panel deep inside their code. Some other manufacturers appear to have done the same.

Full credit goes to [Gero Zahn](http://blog.gerozahn.de/2011/11/kindle-fire-keyboard-layouts-solved/) who was the first person who discovered the "hidden settings panel" for languages in the Kindle Fire.

Many thanks to the users who have tried this app out, provided valuable feedback and acted as beta testers.
