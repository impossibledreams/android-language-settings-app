What Does This App Do?
======================
This is a simple Android application that allows you to access the built in settings screen to select additional input language for your Android keyboard.
The primary motivation for creation of this app was the fact that the Kindle Fire does not allow you to select languages while including the secret settings
panel deep inside their code. Some other manufacturers appear to have done the same.

This app has been tested on Android 2.2, 2.3, 3.2, and 4.0.
